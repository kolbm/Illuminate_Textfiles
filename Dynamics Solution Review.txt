To solve problems involving tension in an elevator, it's essential to understand the forces at play and how they relate to the elevator's motion. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and steps involved:
Understanding the Forces
When an elevator is moving, there are two main forces acting on it:
●
Tension force (FT): This is the upward force exerted by the cable lifting the elevator.
●
Weight (Fg): This is the downward force due to gravity acting on the elevator's mass.
Applying Newton's Second Law
Newton's Second Law of Motion (ΣF = ma) is crucial for analyzing the elevator's motion. This law states that the net force (ΣF) acting on an object is equal to its mass (m) multiplied by its acceleration (a).
Steps to Solve Tension Problems
1.
Draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD):
○
Represent the elevator with a box.
○
Choose a coordinate system with the y-axis vertical.
○
Draw and label the tension force (FT) pointing upward and the weight (Fg) pointing downward.
2.
Identify the Target Variable: Determine what the problem is asking you to find. It could be:
○
Tension in the cable (FT)
○
Acceleration of the elevator (a)
3.
Analyze the Elevator's Motion:
○
Constant speed: If the elevator moves at a constant speed, its acceleration is zero (a = 0). This means the net force is also zero, and the tension force equals the weight (FT = Fg).
○
Upward acceleration: If the elevator accelerates upward, the net force is upward (FT > Fg), and you'll use the equation FT − Fg = ma to solve for the tension force.
○
Downward acceleration: If the elevator accelerates downward, the net force is downward (Fg > FT), and you'll use the equation Fg − FT = ma to solve for the tension force.
4.
Apply Newton's Second Law and Solve:
○
Choose the correct equation based on the elevator's motion (see step 3).
○
Substitute the known values for mass (m), acceleration (a), and weight (Fg = mg, where g = 9.8 m/s²).
○
Solve for the target variable (either FT or a).
Practice Makes Perfect
Working through examples is crucial. You can refer to problems 1(b), 1(c), and 1(d) in "Dynamics Exam - Solutions.pdf" and "Dynamics Exam Solutions" for detailed solutions to elevator problems involving tension. Remember to draw FBDs, identify the target variable, analyze the motion, and apply Newton's Second Law to solve for the unknown.

To effectively solve dynamics problems that involve pulling or pushing an object across a surface with friction, it's crucial to grasp the interplay of forces and how they influence the object's motion. Here's a breakdown of the essential concepts and a step-by-step guide:
Key Concepts
●
Friction Force (Ff): Opposes the motion of an object sliding or moving across a surface. It always acts in the direction opposite to the motion. There are two types:
○
Static Friction: Prevents an object from moving when at rest. It needs to be overcome to initiate motion.
○
Kinetic Friction: Acts on a moving object, working to slow it down.
●
Normal Force (FN): The support force a surface exerts on an object perpendicular to the surface. On a horizontal surface, it often counteracts the object's weight .
●
Applied Force (Fapp): The force exerted on the object, either pulling or pushing it.
●
Coefficient of Friction (μ): Represents the roughness between two surfaces. It's a dimensionless quantity with values between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate greater friction. μk represents the coefficient of kinetic friction.
Step-by-Step Guide
Let's break down the process of solving these types of problems using a structured approach:
1.
Draw a Free Body Diagram (FBD):
○
Represent the object as a simple shape (e.g., a box).
○
Establish a coordinate system with the x-axis parallel to the surface and the y-axis perpendicular to it.
○
Identify and draw all forces acting directly on the object, including:
■
Weight (Fg) acting downwards.
■
Normal Force (FN) acting upwards.
■
Applied Force (Fapp) in the direction of the push or pull.
■
Friction Force (Ff) opposite to the direction of motion.
2.
Calculate the Normal Force (FN):
○
If the surface is horizontal and there's no vertical acceleration, the normal force equals the weight: FN = Fg.
○
Substitute the object's mass (m) and the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s²) to calculate the weight: Fg = mg.
3.
Calculate the Friction Force (Ff):
○
Use the formula: Ff = μkFN, where μk is the coefficient of kinetic friction.
○
Substitute the calculated normal force (FN) and the given coefficient of friction to determine the frictional force.
4.
Determine the Net Force (ΣF):
○
The net force is the vector sum of all forces acting on the object in the horizontal direction.
○
If the applied force is greater than the frictional force, the net force will be in the direction of the applied force. If the frictional force is greater, the net force will be in the opposite direction, and the object may decelerate or remain at rest.
○
In a simple scenario where the applied force and frictional force are the only horizontal forces, you can calculate the net force using: ΣF = Fapp - Ff.
5.
Calculate the Acceleration (a):
○
Apply Newton's Second Law: ΣF = ma.
○
Rearrange the equation to solve for acceleration: a = ΣF / m.
○
Substitute the calculated net force (ΣF) and the object's mass (m) to find the acceleration.

Important Tips
●
Careful Reading: Thoroughly understand the problem's scenario, identifying the forces involved, and whether the object is at rest, moving at a constant velocity, or accelerating.
●
Coordinate System: Choosing an appropriate coordinate system simplifies the analysis of forces and their directions.
●
FBD Accuracy: Ensure all forces are correctly drawn and labeled in the FBD, with arrows indicating their directions and relative magnitudes.
●
Units: Pay close attention to units throughout the calculations and make sure they are consistent.
By following these steps and practicing various scenarios, you'll develop the skills to solve dynamics problems involving friction effectively. Remember that consistent practice is crucial for mastering these concepts and approaching problems with confidence.

Problems involving two objects connected by a string, with one on a table and the other hanging off, are classic examples of pulley systems in physics. These systems illustrate how forces are transmitted through the string and how the motion of one object affects the other. Here's a breakdown of how to approach these problems, drawing on the sources provided:
Understanding the System
●
Forces at play: There are several forces acting on each block in these systems. The weight (Fg) acts on both blocks due to gravity. The tension force (FT) in the string pulls upward on the hanging block and horizontally on the block on the table. The normal force (FN) from the table supports the block resting on it. If friction is present, the friction force (Ff) will act on the block on the table, opposing its motion.
●
Connected motion: The key to solving these problems lies in understanding that the motion of the two blocks is connected. When the hanging block descends, the block on the table moves horizontally. The string ensures that they both move with the same magnitude of acceleration (a).
Steps to Solve the Problem
Let's break down the problem-solving process, referencing Problem 3 from the "Dynamics Exam" and its corresponding solution:
1.
Draw Free Body Diagrams (FBDs): For each block, draw an FBD illustrating all forces acting directly on it.
○
Block A (hanging): The forces are weight (FgA) acting downward and tension (FTA) acting upward.
○
Block B (on table): The forces are weight (FgB) acting downward, normal force (FNB) acting upward, tension (FTB) acting to the right, and potentially friction (Ff) acting to the left if the surface is not frictionless.
2.
Write Equations of Motion: Apply Newton's Second Law (ΣF = ma) to each block separately. Remember that the acceleration (a) is the same for both.
○
Block A: FgA - FTA = mAa
○
Block B: FTB - Ff = mBa
3.
Solve for the Target Variable: Identify what the problem asks you to find. It might be the acceleration of the system, the tension in the string, or the magnitude of the friction force.
○
Acceleration: Often, you need to find the acceleration first. To do this, combine the equations from Step 2, noticing that the tension force is the same in both equations (FTA = FTB = FT). You can eliminate FT and solve for 'a'.
○
Tension: Once you have the acceleration, substitute it back into either of the equations from Step 2 to solve for FT.
○
Friction: If the problem involves friction, you may need to use the equation Ff = μkFN to find the friction force, where μk is the coefficient of kinetic friction.

Additional Tips
●
Choose a Coordinate System: A well-chosen coordinate system simplifies the analysis. Typically, the y-axis is vertical, and the x-axis aligns with the motion direction.
●
Sign Conventions: Be consistent with sign conventions. For example, choose upward and rightward forces as positive and downward and leftward forces as negative.
●
Frictionless vs. With Friction: Problems may specify whether the surfaces are frictionless. If friction is present, include the friction force in your FBDs and equations.
By understanding these steps and practicing with various problems, you'll be well-equipped to solve dynamics problems involving two objects connected by a string in pulley systems. Remember that drawing clear FBDs, applying Newton's Second Law correctly, and being mindful of the interconnected motion are key to success.
